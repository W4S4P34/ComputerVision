# Computer-Vision-12
Find out what is CV, ML and how to implement those things!

```
Finished:
    /SVM&HOG    SVC + HOG (feature detection)

Staged:
    /KNC (k-Neighbors Classifiers)
    /SVM-old    SVM-related
    /SVC        Support Vector Classifiers ('rbf' kernel as default)

Data set:
    /MNIST  MNIST (ungzipped)

Requirements:
    ~~Approx. 600MB hard drive (KNC is memory-hogging)~~
    A bunch of RAM
    The Anaconda Software Distribution (or classic Python3 + resolve-dependencies-yourself combo)
    python-mnist (stuff that handles MNIST the right way(?))
```

How 2 Do Project

[o] Step 0. What the hell is that; an image
[x] Step 1. Where the hell are the numbers
[x] Step 2. What the hell do those numbers mean
[x] Step 3. How the hell do I tell you that I know what the hell those numbers mean

x = OK; o = Partial; None = None
Note: OK != Perfect/Flawless/Completely functional
