# Computer-Vision-12
Find out what is CV, ML and how to implement those things!

```
Ongoing:
    /KNC (k-Neighbors Classifiers)

Staged (i.e. stuff that does not work atm):
    /old    SVM-related
    /SVC    Support Vector Classifiers ('rbf' kernel as default)

Data set:
    /MNIST  MNIST (ungzipped)

Requirements:
    Approx. 600MB hard drive (KNC is memory-hogging)
    A bunch of RAM
    The Anaconda Software Distribution (or classic Python3 + resolve-dependencies-yourself combo)
    python-mnist (stuff that handles MNIST the right way(?))
```
